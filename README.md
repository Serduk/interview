#Practical task
#####to check some level (for instance basic) simply delete two other packages. 
#####you can restore the code using git revert functionality or simply re-clone repository using
`git clone repo_path`
 
command 
##Basic level
####Notes
* **basic.main.BasicLevel** class should not be modified
* structure of packages should not be modified
####Task: 
* make code from **basic.main.BasicLevel** executable
* to reach the goal modify classes **Animal**, **Cat** and **Dog** from **basic.classes** package
* expected output:

`I'am a Doc. My name is Tuzik. Gav`

`I'am a Cat. My name is Vasya. Mew`
## Advanced level 
#####Not implemented yet

##Super advanced level
####Notes
* use `-ea` option in VM options of run configuration for **super_advanced.SuperAdvancedLevel** class 
* code from main() method of **super_advanced.SuperAdvancedLevel** class should not be modified
####Task: 
* make code from  **super_advanced.SuperAdvancedLevel** executable
* to reach the goal modify sub-classes **MailMessage**, **Salary** and **MailService** of **super_advanced.SuperAdvancedLevel** class
* marker of success - all assertions should be passed
