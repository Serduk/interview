# Practical task
##### to check some level (for instance basic) simply delete two other packages (advanced, super_advanced). 
##### you can restore the code using git revert functionality or simply re-clone repository using
`git clone https://github.com/azhelezny/interview.git`
 
command 
## Basic level
### Cat and Dog
### Notes
* **basic.cat.dog.main.BasicLevel** class should not be modified
* structure of packages should not be modified
### Task (Cat, Dog):
* make code from **basic.cat.dog.main.BasicLevel** executable
* to reach the goal modify classes **Animal**, **Cat** and **Dog** from **basic.cat.dog.classes** package
* expected output:

`I'am a Dog. My name is Tuzik. Gav`

`I'am a Cat. My name is Vasya. Mew`
### Task (Mountains and valleys)
Manjunath and Sushrut are planning to go to Himalayan mountains.
But before going there, they want to find out how many valleys are there at the moutainside.
So, you have to count the valleys for them.

U = 1km up, D = 1km down

/\ - mount \\/ - valley

### Task (FizzBazz)
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20.
But for multiples of 3 print “Fizz”
and for the multiples of 5 print “Buzz”.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz”.
## Advanced level 
##### Not implemented yet

## Super advanced level
#### Notes
* use `-ea` option in VM options of run configuration for **super_advanced.SuperAdvancedLevel** class 
* code from main() method of **super_advanced.SuperAdvancedLevel** class should not be modified
#### Task: 
* make code from  **super_advanced.SuperAdvancedLevel** executable
* to reach the goal modify sub-classes **MailMessage**, **Salary** and **MailService** of **super_advanced.SuperAdvancedLevel** class
* marker of success - all assertions should be passed
